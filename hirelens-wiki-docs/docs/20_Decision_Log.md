# HireLens 2.0 — Decision Log

> Every major technical decision gets one entry here, in the order made. This is the permanent record of *why* the project looks the way it does — more durable than any single sprint's findings, and the canonical place to resolve "wait, why did we choose X" months from now.

## Entries

### [Sprint 1, Day 5] Sprint 1 findings confirmed; original redesign report's tech-stack assumptions superseded
**Decision:** Adopt the actual, verified stack (Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Firebase Auth + Firestore via client SDK, OpenRouter/Gemini-2.0-flash-lite, no backend database) as the single source of truth, replacing every earlier placeholder/assumed stack reference in this wiki (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Zustand, Axios, CrewAI, Docker — none confirmed present).
**Reason:** `PROJECT_DISCOVERY.md`, `BACKEND_AUDIT.md`, `FRONTEND_AUDIT.md`, and `ENVIRONMENT_VERIFICATION.md` provide direct, cited evidence of the real stack.
**Alternatives Considered:** None — this is a correction to ground truth, not a choice between options.
**Status:** Accepted

### [Sprint 1, Day 5] Sprint 2 scope locked to production stabilization only
**Decision:** Sprint 2 addresses only Critical/High confirmed issues that block production readiness (build failure, Firestore casing bug, unauthenticated API routes, broken Job Matcher display, hardcoded secrets). Prompt-injection hardening, Context re-render performance, Word export, and PDF-library deduplication are explicitly deferred to Sprint 3+, not dropped.
**Reason:** Per the original project rules, never combine unrelated work in one sprint, and never let "nice to fix" crowd out "must fix before shipping."
**Alternatives Considered:** Bundling all confirmed issues into Sprint 2 regardless of severity — rejected as it would dilute focus on the actual production blockers (build failure, data bug).
**Status:** Accepted

### [Sprint 1, Day 5] API authentication mechanism: Firebase Admin SDK token verification
**Decision:** Secure `/api/*` routes by verifying the Firebase ID token (sent from the already-authenticated client) server-side using the Firebase Admin SDK, rather than introducing a separate auth system.
**Reason:** The project already uses Firebase Auth client-side; introducing a second auth mechanism would duplicate infrastructure the project doesn't need. The Admin SDK is the standard, supported way to verify a Firebase ID token server-side.
**Alternatives Considered:** A custom JWT/session system (rejected — duplicates existing Firebase Auth for no benefit); API keys per client (rejected — doesn't authenticate the actual end user, only an app instance).
**Status:** Accepted
